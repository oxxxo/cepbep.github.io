A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/meldm/pen/mwgbGw.

 Really glad to finally have this working as I'd like. This is a remake of one of my previous pens: https://codepen.io/darrylhuffman/pen/EWOJMW but this one is far more interactive. I hope you all enjoy!

It's kind of hard to make this accurate since I don't really know how a black hole actually looks... There are many different interpretations, some where it gets super bright around the black hole & then black in the middle, but those look dull. I'm taking more of the gravitational lensing approach here now.
